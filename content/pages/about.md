RepoBee is an open source CLI tool that enables teachers to administrate large
amounts of Git student repositories on the GitHub and GitLab platforms. It
automates tasks such as creating repositories for students (or groups) and
filling them with content, batch cloning of student repositories as well as
issue management and light peer review functionality. RepoBee can also be
customized through plugins written in Python.
