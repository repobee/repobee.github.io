RepoBee is an open source CLI tool for administrating large amounts of Git
repositories on GitHub (both .com and self-hosted Enterprise), geared towards
teachers who want to use version control in their courses. It automates tasks
such as creating repositories for students (or groups) and filling them with
content, batch cloning of student repositories as well as issue management and
peer review allocation.
