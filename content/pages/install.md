Installing RepoBee is simple, just execute the install script!

```bash
# for bash
$ bash <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)

# for zsh
$ zsh <(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)
```

Follow the instructions from the install script and you should be good to go.
Visit [the install
documentation](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) for more
elaborate instructions.

> **Note:** Even if your primary shell is not `bash` or `zsh`, you need to
> install RepoBee with one of them. Then you can execute RepoBee with most
> shells.
